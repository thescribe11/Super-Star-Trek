# Super Star Trek

This project is currently under development; it is not yet at a playable state.  
Contributions are welcome; to contribute, please submit a PR which accurately and fully describes your changes/additions. I will review it, and hopefully merge it :)

## The History of Super Star Trek

Created by proto-programmer and ubernerd Mike Mayfield in 1971 by feeding punch-card programs into the Sigma-7 computer, the original Star Trek game - later revised and retitled Super Star Trek, which really should have been the name of JJ Abrams' reboot movie - may have been embarrassingly basic by today's standards, but was amazing back in the day; amazing enough to have stayed alive for decades in the public domain, with other programmers adding and editing as they saw fit.

## This version

The version in this repository is based upon the Tom Almy version of the game.

Besides being a Python 3.8 port (the Almy version is written in C), I have also made some changes of my own, such as changing the torpedoes so that they are targeted via user-inputted linear functions, as opposed to the oversimplified total X and Y displacements that the Almy version uses.

## Running

Source code: In your command line navigate to the source directory, and then enter ```python main.py```.

I will add executables for Windows and Linux once I finish getting the game playable.
